# 3-Tier-Staging-Alert-
This code will extract data from PostgreSQL database that is stored in a JSON data format and checks for unattended warning messages and send it to the next stage/tier if the message continues to be unattended after x hours by checking the PostgreSQL data and updating the user's reaction to the message by inserting that data into the SQL database using V-ONE. For example, if no operational level user attended to the warning message after 1 hour, the ticket will be forwarded to the managerial level user and if no managerial level user attended to the warining message after 3 hours the message will be forwarded to the strategic level user.
